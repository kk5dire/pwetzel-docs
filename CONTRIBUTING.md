# Contributing to the Pwetzel Docs
## If you want to contriube but dont want to get all dirty and write code consider opening a issue with your requests!  
Which you can do [here.](https://github.com/kk5dire/pwetzel-docs/issues/new/choose)


## If you are willing to get all down and dirty:  

You can fork the repo and make a Pull Request and we will try our best to check out what you have.  
If we find what you added is worth the blessing, we will merge it with the main code

PLEASE: Try to follow our main layouts if provided for things like commands etc, Try to keep it formal ex use `"You"/"your"` instead of `"we"/"our"`,  `"We"` instead of `"I"`,
When referring to yourself, use `"we"` (as in "the writers of this guide") instead of ``"I"``   

Try to avoid gendered and otherwise non-inclusive language. Examples are:

- Whitelist -> Allowlist
- Blacklist -> Denylist
- Master/Slave -> Leader/follower, primary/replica, primary/secondary, primary/standby
- Gendered pronouns (e.g. he/him/his) -> They, them, their
- Gendered terms (e.g. guys) -> Folks, people
- Sanity check -> Quick check, confidence check, coherence check
- Dummy value -> Placeholder, sample value

Try to keep things as neet as possible when writing code!!
